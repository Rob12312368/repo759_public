1. I went through a) through c) and understand how to time code, how to submit my assignments with git, and what
the recommended workflow is when it comes to working on my assignment.

2. 
a) cd somedir
b) cat sometext.txt
c) tail -n 5 sometext.txt
d) for file in *.txt; do tail -n 5 $file; done
e) for i in {0..6}; do echo $i; done

3.
a) No modules loaded
b) 14.1.1
c) nvidia/cuda/10.2.2    nvidia/cuda/11.6.0    nvidia/cuda/12.1.0
   nvidia/cuda/11.0.3    nvidia/cuda/11.8.0    nvidia/cuda/12.2.0
   nvidia/cuda/11.3.1    nvidia/cuda/12.0.0    nvidia/cuda/12.5.0 
d) anaconda(mini): It is a python package manager like pip. Also, it lets you create virtual environment
and manage it. Usually, it comes along with a few popular packages when installed, so it is quite convenient.

5.
a) Usually, it runs at the directory that the task is sent from.
b) It is a unique identifier for a job, so that we can do some operation while it is waiting in the queue.
For example, we can cancel it while waiting.
c) We can use "squeue" and check the "ST" column.
d) First "squeue" to find the job id, and "scancel {jobid}" to cancel the job.
e) It is asking for one gpu to run the task.
f) It means running the same job 10 times with id ranging from 0 to 9.
